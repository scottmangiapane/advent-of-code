\--- Part Two ---

Now that you've isolated the inert ingredients, you should have enough information to figure out which ingredient contains which allergen.

In the above example:

*   `mxmxvkd` contains `dairy`.
*   `sqjhc` contains `fish`.
*   `fvjkl` contains `soy`.

Arrange the ingredients _alphabetically by their allergen_ and separate them by commas to produce your _canonical dangerous ingredient list_. (There should _not be any spaces_ in your canonical dangerous ingredient list.) In the above example, this would be _`mxmxvkd,sqjhc,fvjkl`_.

Time to stock your raft with supplies. _What is your canonical dangerous ingredient list?_
