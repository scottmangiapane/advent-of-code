\--- Part Two ---
-----------------

The resulting polymer isn't nearly strong enough to reinforce the submarine. You'll need to run more steps of the pair insertion process; a total of _40 steps_ should do it.

In the above example, the most common element is `B` (occurring `2192039569602` times) and the least common element is `H` (occurring `3849876073` times); subtracting these produces `_2188189693529_`.

Apply _40_ steps of pair insertion to the polymer template and find the most and least common elements in the result. _What do you get if you take the quantity of the most common element and subtract the quantity of the least common element?_
