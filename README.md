## How to Install

1. Clone this repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/scottmangiapane/advent-of-code-2020.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm i
   ```

## How to Use

To run a solution, use the following command:
```
npm run day01
```

Replace "01" with any number between "01" and "25" depending on the day you want to test.

During development it is useful to have scripts re-run automatically when changes are detected. To do this, replace the previous command with:
```
npx nodemon run day01
```
